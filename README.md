Logic Statements

Use the template file determinant.py

The program attempts to find the determinant (yes from Algebra 1) and it is your job to display an appropriate text result for each case.

If the determinant is negative (less than 0) we want to tell the user that there are no solutions to the quadratic formula.

If the determinant is equal to zero we want to tell the user that there exists one solution and then perform the quadratic formula to give the user that solution.

If the determinant is positive we want to tell the user that there exists two solutions and then perform the quadratic formula to give the user those solutions.

Discussion Questions

1. What is the difference between this symbol = and this symbol == in a Python program?
2. Describe how to fix the syntax errors below:
```python
if grade =  100 then
	print(“Perfect Grade and ”)
if grade >= 91
	print(“You have an A”)
```
Assuming that you fixed the program, predict the output if grade is  
3. 101?  
4. 95?  
5. 100?  
6. 90?
